## CFDE Communication Management Overview

We are using a number of services to communicate and share files:
  - [Github](https://github.com/nih-cfde/organization/new/master#github): Code sharing, organization and deliverables tracking
  - [groups.io](https://github.com/nih-cfde/organization/new/master#groupsio): mailing lists
  - [Google Drive Teams](https://github.com/nih-cfde/organization/new/master#google-drive): file sharing
  - [Slack](https://github.com/nih-cfde/organization/new/master#slack): Group chat, forum and instant private messaging

Depending on your role and needs, you may find that the default settings for these services
give you too many, or too few, notifications. On this page you will find instructions for 
altering common settings as well as links out to more detailed information. 

If you are having problems *accessing* these services, please see the [Onboarding Help](https://github.com/nih-cfde/organization/blob/master/OnboardingHelp.md)

### GitHub

#### Definitions

- Organization: Our GitHub Organization is https://github.com/nih-cfde This is the location on the web where you can access all of the CFDE github repositories. We also have an 'organization' repository, which is a folder that contains all the meta information about our Organization
- Repository: Each repository or 'repo' is a self-contained collection of documents and code. There can be any number of repositories in our Organization, and anyone in our group can make a new repository. See the [New Repository Guidelines](NewRepositoryGuide.md) for more info
- Team: Each member of our Organization will be assigned to one or more Teams. The Team(s) you are in determine what repositories you have edit access for. By default everyone has at least read access to all CFDE repositories. Teams can also be tagged into conversations and have other useful features. Anyone in our group can make new teams. 
- Pull Request: A Pull Request or 'PR' is the main way to share your own edits to documents in a repository
- Branch: Since many people might work on a document simultanously, when anyone makes an edit to a document GitHub makes that change on a different 'branch', so each person can make their own changes and then submit their version to the group for approval via a Pull Request
- Commit: Essentially saving. When you are making changes to a document in your branch, you need to commit your changes before you leave the page. If you are making a lot of changes, you can do many commits and submit all the changes on your branch as one Pull Request.
- Review Request: To ensure that errors aren't accidently introduced into important code and documents, all Pull Requests must be reviewed by at least one other person before they are merged into the official version
- Merge: Once you have submitted a Pull Request, and it has been approved via review, you can merge your changes, at which point your version of the document is the version displayed in the repository
- Issues: Issues are ways to make comments or requests in a repository

#### Changing Notifications

By default, your Github account will automatically 'watch' repositories and teams that you are added to, and by default it will
email you notifications each time there is a PR, Commit, Review Request, Issue or Comment on any of those repositories, and also
whenever a new repository is made in our Organization. 

However, unless you are actively working in a repository, you probably don't need to be notified of every change. 
There are two places where you will need to change your settings to reduce the number of times GitHub contacts you.

##### Watching Settings

First, make sure you are only watching repos that you are actively interested in tracking. Since everyone in our Organization has at least read access to all our repos, you'll be watching all of them, regardless of how they relate to your role. You can see all the repos you are watching at this link: https://github.com/watching
You should get something like this:

For each repository in the list, decide how often you want to hear about it. There are four options: 'Not Watching', 'Releases Only', 'Watching' and 'Ignoring'
<img src="/images/watchingoptions.png" alt="Watching Options" width="600"/>

For repositories that you actively work in, and would like to be notified of things like PRs and conversations, choose 'Watching'. You can set what types of actions send you notifications using the [Notification Settings] instructions below.

For most other repositories, you will likely want to set them to 'Not Watching' or 'Releases Only'. Both of these options will
only send you notifications if someone specifically invokes you or your team in a PR, comment, etc.

If you are sure you will never be interested in a repository, you can set it to 'Ignoring'. This will stop all notifications, even if people specifically mention you. As this is a collaborative project and your colleagues might request your input in places you didn't expect, we do not advise setting CFDE repos to 'Ignoring'. 

##### Notification Settings

Once you have determined which repos you want to watch, you can change what triggers watching notifications, as well as
edit the default behavior of watching everything. You edit these settings at: https://github.com/settings/notifications
