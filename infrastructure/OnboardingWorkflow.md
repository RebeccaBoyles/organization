# Workflow for onboarding new members to services (requires admin rights to all resources)

To fully onboard, a new member must:
 - Fill out the onboarding form
 - Accept our Slack invite
 - Accept our GitHub invite
 
 We track those events, as well as our progress in adding them to our resources [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16JcTqlkCRPqrSnykqshrVM2XLf_3HJJiPpAb7qBaOug/edit?usp=sharing).

## Onboarding Overview
The Onboarding form should be checked and updated at least every other business day. Onboarding each person is a typically a multi-day process, because you have to wait for them to accept your invitations before you can proceed with the final steps. The basic workflow is:
  
  - Add them to our Google Group, and send them invitations to Slack and GitHub
  - Add their name to the "Welcome" list in the Weekly Announcements
  - Add them to the MPQ form
  - Wait for them to accept the invitations
  - Add them to the correct mailing lists

## Onboarding Walkthrough
To onboard new members, or to continue boarding partially onboarded members, first navigate to the [Onboarding Reponses Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16JcTqlkCRPqrSnykqshrVM2XLf_3HJJiPpAb7qBaOug/edit?usp=sharing).
  Individuals who have newly requested onboarding will not have checks in the first six columns of the spreadsheet. Partially onboarded members will have some boxes checked.
  
  Onboarding tasks should be completed (or checked up on) from left to right for each individual.

### Google Group adds

  If 'Added to Google Group?' is unchecked:
   - Copy their email address from column K, if they don't have one, use the email address in column J
   - Note their Title/Position from column Q and affiliation from column P
   - Decide what Google Permissions group to add them to:
      - For members of Teams Brown or White who are working on infrastructure or data access management, choose [CFDE_Admin](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!managemembers/cfde_admin/add)
      - For everyone else, choose [CFDE_Everyone](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!managemembers/cfde_everyone/add)
   - (You can also reach those pages by going to [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!myforums), choosing 'Manage members' for the appropriate group, and then clicking 'Direct add members' on the left side of the screen.)
   - Enter the email address of the person you want to onboard. If you have more than one to add to a given group, you can add multiple, comma-seperated, email addresses
   - Ensure that the welcome message box is filled correctly (see below), then click `Add` at the top of the screen
   - As soon as you've added them to the Google Group, you should add them to the Welcome list on the Announcements list. Go to https://github.com/nih-cfde/announcements/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+Announcements
   - Click on the issue called "Weekly Announcements"
   - Scroll to the bottom of the page to the text box.
   - Make the first line say `# Welcome`
   - List the name and group affiliation of each person you added to Google Groups as in: `Brown: Amanda Charbonneau, Titus Brown`
   - Click the `Comment` button
   - Check the 'Added to Google Group?' box for each person you added

  - Note their Title/Position from column Q and affiliation from column P

 ### Add to MPQ
 
 If 'Added to MQP as of?' is blank:
 - Check their Affiliation(s) in column P, only members of the Tech Teams (Brown, Foster, Kesselman, Maâ€™ayan, O'Connor, Sansone and White) need to be added to the MPQ
 - Note the name and affilitation for each person you need to add (columns L and P)
 - Navigate to the MPQs folder in CFDE Admin on Google: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1G7omyAgRSQr-n6F4o3HWUKcRm_cvoOHJ
 - Find the MPQ that is due this month and open the form for editing
 - Scroll down to the correct Tech Team
 - Click on the last person listed in that Tech Team, the one right before the 'What DCC interactions has your team had this month?' question
 - The individuals question should switch to editing mode. You may have to click it more than once
 - At the bottom of their section, click on the copy icon. It looks like two, mostly overlapping rectangles
 - You should now have two copies of that individuals questions. Copy the new team member over the name in the new copy
 - Click anywhere else on the screen
 - Add the correct month_year in the 'Added to MQP as of?' column for each person you added

### Check Slack Invite

If 'Slack Invite Accepted?' is unchecked:
  - Go to this link: https://cfdeworkspace.slack.com/admin/invites#pending (you may need to log into your Slack account)
  - If their invitation has moved to 'Accepted Invitations', click the checkbox
  - You can search for them using their email address in column J
  - Check the 'Slack Invite Accepted?' box for each person you added

### Add to Mailing lists

If you have just updated their 'Slack Invite Accepted?' checkbox, then you also need to add them to mailing lists (next section)
 - Note the mailing lists they requested to join in column R (see NOTE1 for help)
 - Go to https://cfde.groups.io/g/General/subgroupmembers (see NOTE2 for help)
 - Check the boxes next to their name for their selected lists (you can do multiple members at a time)
 - Click `Update`
 - Click `Yes` in the dialogue box that appears (Yes has a trash can for some reason)
 - Check the 'Mailing Lists Assigned?' box for each person you added
 
     NOTE1: It's basically impossible to read column R for members that choose more than one list.
     It's much easier to read their choices directly off their form. To do that:
       
      - Go to https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sFY6y2eHB3PS0HayEyxXtZOrBJV7lfT8thJ8bL9wKqQ/edit#responses
      - Click on the 'Individual' tab
      - Click where it says 'achar@ucdavis.edu'. That will open a selection box where you can choose the email address of the member you're working on
      - Choose the right email address
      - Scroll to the bottom of their form to the 'Mailing List Options' section
       
    NOTE2: Members are automatically added to groups.io when they accept their Slack invite, 
     however the sync can take up to one hour. If someone has accepted thier Slack invite, but
     does not appear in the subgroupmembers page, you can force the sync to happen immediately by:
       
      - Go to https://cfde.groups.io/g/General/syncslackmembers
      - Click the 'Slack Members' tab
      - Check the box next to the members name
      - Click the `Add to Groups.io` button

 ### Check GitHub Invite
 
 If 'GitHub Invite Accepted?' is unchecked:
  - Go to https://github.com/orgs/nih-cfde/people
  - Click on 'X pending invitations'. It will be just below the `Invite member` button.
  - Use the dialogue box to update 'GitHub Invite Accepted?' checkmarks
