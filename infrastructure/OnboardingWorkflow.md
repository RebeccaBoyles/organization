# Workflow for onboarding new members to services (requires admin rights to all resources)

To fully onboard, a new member must:
 - Fill out the onboarding form
 - Accept our Slack invite
 - Accept our GitHub invite
 
 We track those events, as well as our progress in adding them to our resources [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16JcTqlkCRPqrSnykqshrVM2XLf_3HJJiPpAb7qBaOug/edit?usp=sharing).

## Onboarding Walkthrough
To onboard new members, or to continue boarding partially onboarded members, first navigate to the [Onboarding Reponses Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16JcTqlkCRPqrSnykqshrVM2XLf_3HJJiPpAb7qBaOug/edit?usp=sharing).
  Individuals who have newly requested onboarding will not have checks in the first six columns of the spreadsheet. Partially onboarded members will have some boxes checked.
  
  Onboarding tasks should be completed (or checked up on) from left to right for each individual.

### Google Group adds

  If 'Added to Google Group?' is unchecked:
   - Copy their email address from column I, if they don't have one, use the email address in H
   - Note their Title/Position from column ) and affiliation from column N
   - Decide what Google Permissions group to add them to:
      - For members of Teams Brown or White who are working on infrastructure or data access management, choose [CFDE_Admin](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!managemembers/cfde_admin/add)
      - For everyone else, choose [CFDE_Everyone](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!managemembers/cfde_everyone/add)
   - (You can also reach those pages by going to [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!myforums), choosing 'Manage members' for the appropriate group, and then clicking 'Direct add members' on the left side of the screen.)
   - Enter the email address of the person you want to onboard. If you have more than one to add to a given group, you can add multiple, comma-seperated, email addresses
   - Ensure that the welcome message box is filled correctly (see below), then click `Add` at the top of the screen
   - Check the 'Added to Google Group?' box for each person you added

### Slack space adds

  If 'Slack Invite Sent?' is unchecked:
   - Copy their email address from column H
   - In your CFDE Slack window, click '+Invite people'. (It will just below your list of Direct Messages in the sidebar)
   - Paste their email address into the box. You can add more than one person at a time.
   - Check the 'Slack Invite Sent?' box for each person you added
   
### GitHub adds

  If 'GitHub Invite Sent?' is unchecked:
  - Copy their GitHubID from column M
  - Note their Title/Position from column N and affiliation from column M
  - Go to https://github.com/orgs/nih-cfde/people
  - Click `Invite Member`
  - Paste thier GitHubID into the box (don't put an `@` in front of it)
  - Click on the rendered version of their GitHubID that pops up. Be sure it's the right person!
  - Click `Invite`
  - Scroll down and click 'Show all XX teams'
  - Based on their Title/Position and affiliation, add them to as many teams as is appropriate
  - Click `Send Invite`
  - Check the 'GitHub Invite Sent?' box for each person you added

### Check Slack Invite

If 'Slack Invite Accepted?' is unchecked:
  - Go to this link: https://cfdeworkspace.slack.com/admin/invites#pending (you may need to log into your Slack account)
  - If their invitation has moved to 'Accepted Invitations', click the checkbox
  - You can search for them using their email address in column H
  - Check the 'Slack Invite Accepted?' box for each person you added

### Add to Mailing lists

If you have just updated their 'Slack Invite Accepted?' checkbox, then you also need to add them to mailing lists (next section)
 - Note the mailing lists they requested to join in column P (see NOTE1 for help)
 - Go to https://cfde.groups.io/g/General/subgroupmembers (see NOTE2 for help)
 - Check the boxes next to their name for their selected lists (you can do multiple members at a time)
 - Click `Update`
 - Click `Yes` in the dialogue box that appears (Yes has a trash can for some reason)
 - Check the 'Mailing Lists Assigned?' box for each person you added
 
     NOTE1: It's basically impossible to read column P for members that choose more than one list.
     It's much easier to read their choices directly off their form. To do that:
       
       - Go to https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sFY6y2eHB3PS0HayEyxXtZOrBJV7lfT8thJ8bL9wKqQ/edit#responses
       - Click on the 'Individual' tab
       - Click where it says 'achar@ucdavis.edu'. That will open a selection box where you can choose the email address of the member you're working on
       - Choose the right email address
       - Scroll to the bottom of their form to the 'Mailing List Options' section
       
    NOTE2: Members are automatically added to groups.io when they accept their Slack invite, 
     however the sync can take up to one hour. If someone has accepted thier Slack invite, but
     does not appear in the subgroupmembers page, you can force the sync to happen immediatly by:
       
       - Go to https://cfde.groups.io/g/General/syncslackmembers
       - Click the 'Slack Members' tab
       - Check the box next to the members name
       - Click the `Add to Groups.io` button
    
  

 ### Check GitHub Invite
 
 If 'GitHub Invite Accepted?' is unchecked:
  - Go to https://github.com/orgs/nih-cfde/people
  - Click on 'X pending invitations'. It will be just below the `Invite member` button.
  - Use the dialogue box to update checkmarks
