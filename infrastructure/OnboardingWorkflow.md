# Workflow for onboarding new members to services (requires admin rights to all resources)

To fully onboard, a new member must:
 - Fill out the onboarding form
 - Accept our Slack invite
 - Accept our GitHub invite
 
 We track those events, as well as our progress in adding them to our resources [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16JcTqlkCRPqrSnykqshrVM2XLf_3HJJiPpAb7qBaOug/edit?usp=sharing).

## Onboarding Walkthrough
To onboard new members, or to continue boarding partially onboarded members, first navigate to the [Onboarding Reponses Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16JcTqlkCRPqrSnykqshrVM2XLf_3HJJiPpAb7qBaOug/edit?usp=sharing).
  Individuals who have newly requested onboarding will not have checks in the first six columns of the spreadsheet. Partially onboarded members will have some boxes checked.
  
  Onboarding tasks should be completed (or checked up on) from left to right for each individual.

### Google Group adds

  If 'Added to Google Group?' is unchecked:
   - Copy their email address from column G
   - Note their Title/Position from column M and affiliation from column L
   - Decide what Google Permissions group to add them to:
      - For members of Teams Brown or White who are working on infrastructure or data access management, choose [CFDE_Admin](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!managemembers/cfde_admin/add)
      - For everyone else, choose [CFDE_Everyone](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!managemembers/cfde_everyone/add)
   - (You can also reach those pages by going to [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!myforums), choosing 'Manage members' for the appropriate group, and then clicking 'Direct add members' on the left side of the screen.)
   - Enter the email address of the person you want to onboard. If you have more than one to add to a given group, you can add multiple, comma-seperated, email addresses
   - Ensure that the welcome message box is filled correctly (see below), then click `Add` at the top of the screen
   - Check the 'Added to Google Group?' box for each person you added
